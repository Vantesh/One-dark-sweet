# One Dark Sweet Theme

This is a customized version of the One Dark pro theme for Visual Studio Code. It has been modified to my own liking by using a sweet colors paired with one dark pro syntax highlighting colors and **supports italic**.

## Installation

You can install this theme directly from the [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vantesh.one-dark-sweet) or follow the steps below:

1. Open the **Extensions** sidebar in Visual Studio Code
2. Search for **One Dark Sweet**
3. Click **Install**
4. Click **Reload** to reload the editor
5. Navigate to **File > Preferences > Color Theme** and select **One Dark Sweet**

> **NOTE**: The font used in the screenshot is [Fisa Code](https://git.sainnhe.dev/sainnhe/icursive-nerd-font/src/branch/master/dist/Fisa%20Code) in order to achieve the cursive style

You can enable font ligatures and other styles by coping this on your settings.json file
if you are using fira code or Fisa code mentioned above:

```
"editor.fontLigatures": "'cv01', 'cv02', 'cv06','ss01','ss03','ss04','cv16','cv31','cv30','cv28'",
```
